1. Starting with error handling


The TRY‚Ä¶CATCH syntax

BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
        VALUES ('Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018', 10, 3499.99);
    SELECT 'Product inserted correctly!';

    BEGIN CATCH
        SELECT 'An error occurred! You are in the CATCH block';   
    END CATCH
END TRY


Which of the following is true about the syntax?

 This script is correct because the error is handled within the CATCH block, and everything must be enclosed by the TRY block.
<b> This script isn‚Äôt correct because the CATCH block must start after the end of the TRY block. <\b> >> TRUE
 This script isn‚Äôt correct because the error should be handled in the TRY block.
 
 

Your first error-handling script
Surround the constraint with a TRY block.

Add the constraint to the products table.

Surround the error message with a CATCH block.

BEGIN TRY
	ALTER TABLE products
		ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_Stock CHECK (stock >= 0);
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
	SELECT 'An error occurred!';
END CATCH

  
</> Nesting TRY‚Ä¶CATCH constructs
Surround the INSERT INTO buyers statement with a TRY block.

Surround the error handling with a CATCH block.

Surround the INSERT INTO errors statement with another TRY block.

Surround the nested error handling with another CATCH block.

BEGIN TRY
	INSERT INTO buyers (first_name, last_name, email, phone)
		VALUES ('Peter', 'Thompson', 'peterthomson@mail.com', '555000100');
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
	SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the buyer! You are in the first CATCH block';
    BEGIN TRY
    	INSERT INTO errors 
        	VALUES ('Error inserting a buyer');
        SELECT 'Error inserted correctly!';
	END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
    	SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the error! You are in the nested CATCH block';
    END CATCH 
END CATCH

  

Anatomy review
When you execute the following script:

INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
    VALUES ('Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018', 10, 3499.99);

  
  
The console of your SQL Server shows this:

Msg 2627, Level 14, State 1, Line 1
Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint 'unique_name'. 
Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.products'. 
The duplicate key value is (Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018).

  
  
What are the different parts of the error you get, from left to right?

 Message level, severity level, state, line, and message text.
 Error number, line, state, severity level, and message text.
 Error number, severity level, state, line, and message text.

Correcting compilation errors
Note: Error messages in DataCamp have different anatomy than in SQL Server, but as they show the error message, you won‚Äôt have any problem.

Run the code to verify there are compilation errors.
Correct every compilation error.
Run the code to get the final output: An error occurred inserting the product!
START TRY
	INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
		VALUES ('Sun Bicycles ElectroLite - 2017', 10, 1559.99);
FINISH TRY
START CACH
	SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the product!';
    START TRY
    	INSERT INTO errors
        	VALUES ('Error inserting a product');
    FINISH TRY    
    BEGIN CACH
    	SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the error!';
    FINISH CACH    
FINISH CACH

BEGIN TRY
	INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
		VALUES ('Sun Bicycles ElectroLite - 2017', 10, 1559.99);
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
	SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the product!';
    BEGIN TRY
    	INSERT INTO errors
        	VALUES ('Error inserting a product');
    END TRY    
    BEGIN CATCH
    	SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the error!';
    END CATCH    
END CATCH

An error occurred inserting the product!



Error function syntax
Which of the following is true about the functions ERROR_NUMBER(), ERROR_SEVERITY(), ERROR_STATE(), ERROR_PROCEDURE(), ERROR_LINE(), and ERROR_MESSAGE()?

 These functions must be placed within the TRY block, just after the statement which may cause an error. If an error occurs, they return information about the error.
 These functions must be placed within the CATCH block. If an error occurs within the TRY block, they return information about the error.
 These functions must be placed within the CATCH block. They will return NULL values if there are no errors.


Using error functions
Surround the operation with a TRY block.

Surround the functions with a CATCH block.

Select the error information.

BEGIN TRY  	
	SELECT 'Total: ' + SUM(price * quantity) AS total
	FROM orders  
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH  
	SELECT  ERROR_NUMBER() AS number,  
        	ERROR_SEVERITY() AS severity_level,  
        	ERROR_STATE() AS state,
        	ERROR_LINE() AS line,  
        	ERROR_MESSAGE() AS message; 	
END CATCH 

number	severity_level	state	line	message
8114	16				5		3		Error converting data type varchar to numeric.




Using error functions in a nested TRY‚Ä¶CATCH
Surround the error handling with a CATCH block.

Insert ‚ÄòError inserting a product‚Äô in the errors table and surround this insertion with another TRY block.

Surround the nested error handling with another CATCH block.

Select the error line and the error message in the inner CATCH block.

BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price) 
    VALUES	('Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018', 2, 3499.99),   		
    		('New Power K- 2018', 3, 1999.99)		
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
	SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the product!';
    BEGIN TRY
    	INSERT INTO errors 
        	VALUES ('Error inserting a product');
    END TRY    
    BEGIN CATCH
    	SELECT 
        	ERROR_LINE() AS line,	   
			ERROR_MESSAGE() AS message; 
    END CATCH    
END CATCH

An error occurred inserting the product!



2. Raising, throwing and customizing your errors
</> RAISERROR syntax
Given this RAISERROR statement

RAISERROR(‚ÄòYou cannot apply a 50%% discount on %s number %d‚Äô, 6, 1, ‚Äòproduct‚Äô, 5);

Which of the following outputs will you get if you execute this code?

 ‚ÄúYou cannot apply a 6% discount on 1 product number 5‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou cannot apply a 50% discount on product number 5‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou cannot apply a 50%% discount on product number 5‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou cannot apply a 50% discount on 5 number product‚Äù
</> CATCHING the RAISERROR
Set @product_id to 5.

Use the RAISERROR statement with a severity of 11, a state of 1 and the given @product_id.

DECLARE @product_id INT = 5;

IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = @product_id)
	RAISERROR('No product with id %d.', 11, 1, @product_id);
ELSE 
	SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = @product_id;

product_id	product_name			stock	price
5			Trek CrossRip+ - 2018	12		4499.99


Catch the error generated by the RAISERROR statement you coded.

Select the error message using the appropriate function.

BEGIN TRY
    DECLARE @product_id INT = 5;
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = @product_id)
        RAISERROR('No product with id %d.', 11, 1, @product_id);
    ELSE 
        SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = @product_id;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
	SELECT ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH  

product_id	product_name			stock	price
5			Trek CrossRip+ - 2018	12		4499.99



</> THROW with or without parameters
Which of the following is true about the THROW statement?

 The THROW statement without parameters should be placed within a CATCH block.
 The THROW statement with parameters can only be placed within a CATCH block.
 The THROW statement without parameters can‚Äôt re-throw an original error.
</> THROW without parameters
Surround the error handling with a CATCH block.

Insert the error in the errors table.

End the insert statement with a semicolon (üòâ.

Re-throw the original error.

CREATE PROCEDURE insert_product
  @product_name VARCHAR(50),
  @stock INT,
  @price DECIMAL

AS

BEGIN TRY
	INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
		VALUES (@product_name, @stock, @price);
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    INSERT INTO errors VALUES ('Error inserting a product');
	THROW; 
END CATCH


</> Executing a stored procedure that throws an error
Execute the stored procedure called insert_product.

Set the appropriate values for the parameters of the stored procedure.

Surround the error handling with a CATCH block.

Select the error message.

BEGIN TRY
	EXEC insert_product
    	@product_name = 'Super bike',
        @stock = 10,
        @price = 4999.99;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
	SELECT ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH



</> THROW with parameters
Set @staff_id to 4.

Use the THROW statement, with 50001 as the error number, ‚ÄòNo staff member with such id‚Äô as the message text, and 1 as the state.

DECLARE @staff_id INT = 4;

IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM staff WHERE staff_id = @staff_id)
	THROW 50001, 'No staff member with such id', 1;
ELSE
   	SELECT * FROM staff WHERE staff_id = @staff_id

staff_id	first_name	last_name	email					phone
4			Mateo		Casanovas	mateocasanovas@mail.com	555110996



</> Ways of customizing error messages
You want to use the THROW statement to throw an error with a custom message. Which of the following is a possible option to do so?

 You use the CONCATMESSAGE function and save the result into a variable that you pass to the THROW statement.
 You use the CONCATMESSAGE function and save the result into a variable that you pass to the THROW statement.
 You use the FORMATMESSAGE function inside the THROW statement.
</> Concatenating the message
Set the @first_name variable to ‚ÄòPedro‚Äô.

Assign to the @my_message variable the concatenation of the text 'There is no staff member with ‚Äò, with the value of the @first_name variable and with the text ‚Äô as the first name.‚Äô.

Use the THROW statement with 50000 as the error number, @my_message variable as the message parameter, and 1 as the state.

DECLARE @first_name NVARCHAR(20) = 'Pedro';
DECLARE @my_message NVARCHAR(500) =
	CONCAT('There is no staff member with ', @first_name, ' as the first name.');
	
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM staff WHERE first_name = @first_name)
	THROW 50000, @my_message, 1;



</> FORMATMESSAGE with message string
Save into the @current_stock variable the value of the stock of the product.

Use the FORMATMESSAGE function with parameter placeholders (%s, %d, ‚Ä¶ ) to customize the error message. The message has to be 'There are not enough (the given product name) bikes. You only have (the stock of the product) in stock.'

Pass to the THROW statement the variable of the custom message.

DECLARE @product_name AS NVARCHAR(50) = 'Trek CrossRip+ - 2018';
DECLARE @number_of_sold_bikes AS INT = 10;
DECLARE @current_stock INT;
SELECT @current_stock = stock FROM products WHERE product_name = @product_name;

DECLARE @my_message NVARCHAR(500) =
	FORMATMESSAGE('There are not enough %s bikes. You only have %d in stock.', @product_name, @current_stock);

IF (@current_stock - @number_of_sold_bikes < 0)
	THROW 50000, @my_message, 1;



</> FORMATMESSAGE with message number
Pass to the sp_addmessage stored procedure 50002 as the message id, 16 as the severity, and ‚ÄòThere are not enough %s bikes. You only have %d in stock.‚Äô as the message text.

Use FORMATMESSAGE, setting the first parameter (message number) to be 50002. Complete the second and the third parameters to replace the parameter placeholders of the message (%s and %d) with the appropriate variables.

Pass to the THROW statement the custom message.

EXEC sp_addmessage @msgnum = 50002, @severity = 16, @msgtext = 'There are not enough %s bikes. You only have %d in stock.', @lang = N'us_english';

DECLARE @product_name AS NVARCHAR(50) = 'Trek CrossRip+ - 2018';
DECLARE @number_of_sold_bikes AS INT = 10;
DECLARE @current_stock INT;
SELECT @current_stock = stock FROM products WHERE product_name = @product_name;
DECLARE @my_message NVARCHAR(500) =
	FORMATMESSAGE('There are not enough %s bikes. You only have %d in stock.', @product_name, @current_stock);

IF (@current_stock - @number_of_sold_bikes < 0)
	THROW 50000, @my_message, 1;



3. Transactions in SQL Server
</> Transaction statements
Which of the following is not correct about transaction statements?

 The BEGIN TRAN|TRANSACTION statement marks the starting point of a transaction.
 The COMMIT TRAN|TRANSACTION statement marks the end of a successful transaction.

4. Controlling the concurrency: Transaction isolation levels
</> Concurrency phenomena
Which of the following is true about these concurrency phenomena?

 Non-repeatable reads occur when a transaction reads data that has been modified by another transaction without been yet committed.
You have to think a little bit more. It is dirty reads that occur when a transaction reads data that has been modified by another transaction without been yet committed.

 Dirty reads occur when a transaction reads a record twice, but the first result is different from the second result as a consequence of another committed transaction altered this data.
You have to think a little bit more. It is non-repeatable reads that occur when a transaction reads a record twice, but the first result is different from the second result as a consequence of another committed transaction altered this data.

 Phantom reads occur when a transaction reads some records twice, but the first result it gets is different from the second result as a consequence of another committed transaction having inserted a row.
 Non-repeatable reads occur when a transaction reads some records twice, but the first result it gets is different from the second result as a consequence of another committed transaction having inserted a row.

</> Comparing WITH (NOLOCK) & READ UNCOMMITTED
Can you help him to clarify the differences between using WITH (NOLOCK) option and the READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level?

 The WITH (NOLOCK) option behaves like the READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level. But, whereas the isolation level applies to a specific table, the WITH (NOLOCK) option applies for the entire connection.
 The WITH (NOLOCK) option doesn‚Äôt behave like the READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level because the first one can‚Äôt read dirty reads.
 The WITH (NOLOCK) option behaves like the READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level. But whereas the isolation level applies for the entire connection, WITH NOLOCK applies to a specific table.
